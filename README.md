# 📊 SuperKart Sales Forecasting Project

## 🏢 Business Context
A **sales forecast** predicts future revenue using historical data, industry trends, and the current sales pipeline. Accurate forecasting enables organizations to:

- Plan sales operations by region  
- Support supply chain teams with procurement decisions  
- Reduce risks in the sales pipeline  
- Improve decision‑making and long‑term strategy  
- Establish benchmarks for future trend analysis  

For a retail business, forecasting is essential to optimize inventory, reduce stockouts, and align operations across departments.
